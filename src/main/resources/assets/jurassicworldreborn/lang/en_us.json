  "info.apatosaurus": "Native to North America, Apatosaurus was a diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic Period(152 - 151 million years ago). On average, Apatosaurus grew to about 22.8 meters long and weighed around 16-25 tons. They are mostly docile animals and peacefully graze together from small pairs to large herds (about 2 - 15 individuals), normally led by an elderly alpha female (\"matriarch\").",
  "info.baryonyx": "Native to Europe and Africa, Baryonyx was a spinosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period, (130-125 million years ago). They are thought to have hunted mostly fish and other aquatic prey. It is surprisingly mild-mannered for a carnivore, however, because of its size, the Baryonyx may sometimes consider humans or small dinosaurs prey when hungry.",
  "info.beelzebufo": "Also known as the devil frog, the devil toad, or the frog from hell, Beelzebufo was a species of common horned frog (or \"Pac-Man\" frog). It inhabited Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous period(70 million years ago). Due to its size and monstrous, horned head, this frog is named after Beelzebub, a Biblical demon closely associated or synonymous with Satan.",
  "info.alvarezsaurus": "Alvarezsaurus was a reasonably small (2 meters long) theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period(86 - 83 million years ago). It is native to modern day Argentina. Alvarezsaurus, cutely nicknamed the \"Alvy\" or \"Alvie\", is not dangerous to humans. This inquisitive crepuscular creature mainly hunts insects and sometimes would eat small mammals or lizards.",
  "info.ammonite": "The Perisphinctes Ammonite is an extinct cephalopod subclass that lived throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (Early Devonian - end of the Late Cretaceous). Perhaps some of the most famous extinct animals, the Persphinctes are known for their spiral shells. The shells appear similar to nautilus shells from a distance, but can be identified by indentations, bumps, or even \"spikes\" on the sutures that divide the chambers of their shells.",
  "info.ankylosaurus": "Ankylosaurus was a large ankylosaurid from the late Cretaceous period in North America. It is commonly referred to as a “living tank” due to its enhanced methods of defence. These animals are prone to high levels of aggression due to their minimal brain size and weak vision. This creature is to be taken seriously when encountered and should be treated with delicate care.",
  "info.allosaurus": "One of the largest land-living predators of the Late Jurassic period (around 155 - 150 million years ago) the Allosaurus was a large, carnivorous theropod dinosaur. Its remains have been found in the United States, Portugal and regions of Africa. Allosaurus might also have hunted in groups on occasion to bring down really large prey such as sauropods.",
  "info.alligator_gar": "One of the largest freshwater fish in North America, the Alligator Gar is found in the southern United States and northern Mexico. These fish can grow up to 3 meters long, and they are found in fresh to brackish lakes, rivers, swamps, estuaries and bays in a temperate to subtropical climate.The gar itself is a stalking ambush predator that eats mostly smaller fish, though they have also been known to eat small mammals from the water's surface.",
  "info.achillobator": "The Achillobator, or the “Achilles warrior”, was one of the largest known dromaeosaurids, measuring around 5 meters long when fully grown. These dinosaurs lived in Mongolia, around 93 - 80 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Because of its bones, experts believe that the Achillobator was either a new type of dinosaur or a “chimera” mistakenly reconstructed from two different dinosaurs.",
  "info.mamenchisaurus": "Native to China during the Late Jurassic Period(160-145 million years ago), Mamenchisaurus had a neck that made up about half its body. Most species of Mamenchisaurus had a body length of about 15-25 meters, but one species, M. sinocanadorum, is thought to have been able to reach lengths of up to 35 meters, making it one of the longest sauropods.",
  "info.triceratops": "The Triceratops lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period. They were herbivorous, eating mainly palms, cycads, and ferns. When fully grown, Triceratops measured 8-9 meters long and weighed 6-12 tons. The head frill was used for display, while the horns were used for attack and defence. Triceratops lives in family groups of 5 - 15 individuals led by an adult female matriarch.",
  "info.dilophosaurus": "The Dilophosaurus, an Early Jurassic theropod from Arizona, was one of the first large predatory dinosaurs at 6-7 meters long. It had twin crests on its head for display. They are actually venomous, preferring to spit venom into its prey's eyes. If the venom hits the eyes, it causes blindness, agonizing pain, and eventually paralysis. It live in small, disorganized gangs(3 to 10 individuals) of both males and females.",
  "info.brachiosaurus": "The Brachiosaurus was a giant sauropod that lived in North America during the late Jurassic period. It can grow up to 25 - 26 meters long, more than 9 meters in height and weighs up to 40 tons. It is thought to have browsed from the tops of trees, eating mostly ginkgo leaves, conifers, tree-ferns and large cycads. They live in herds of 2 - 15 individuals, led by an alpha male or female. They make \"singing\" calls to communicate with one another.",
  "info.parasaurolophus": "Parasaurolophus was a hadrosaur that lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period. It measured 10 meters long, and weighed 2.5 tons. The curved, tubular crest on its head was hollow, and used to produce sound. Parasaurolophus was a herbivore, and used its cheek teeth to grind its food. Parasaurolophus lived in herds of about 5 - 50, with a mix of males and females. Their calls can travel for miles, and they are very loud.",
  "info.tyrannosaurus": "The Tyrannosaurus Rex was a huge theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous period in North America. It grew about 12-13 meters long and weighed 6 tons. The healed bite wounds from tyrannosaurus’ found on herbivore bones suggest that it was a predator, however, it also scavenged. They led a violent lifestyle, and were fiercely territorial. The Tyrannosaurus Rex is magnificent, but are not to be taken lightly!",
  "info.velociraptor": "The Velociraptor was a small theropod dinosaur that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. It was an opportunist, hunting a wide variety of prey from small mammals or lizards, to medium-sized dinosaurs. Quick, highly intelligent and highly aggressive, they are very hard to keep. They are accomplished escape artists, rivaling a cheetah's speed and leaping up to 4 meters vertically.",
  "info.gallimimus": "Gallimimus was a herbivorous theropod that lived in Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous period. It measured 6 to 8 meters when fully grown. It preferred to live near water, grazing on vegetation and algae. Gallimimus was a fast runner, though the top speed is currently unknown. They are herding animals(10 to 100 individuals), usually a mix of males and females. They are extremely panicky, and any potential threat can cause a stampede.",
  "info.microraptor": "One of the most famous feathered dinosaurs ever found, the Microraptor lived in northeast China during the Early Cretaceous period(125-122 million years ago). Their feathers are known to have been iridescent black. Experts speculate that they had the possibility of gliding because of these feathers. The Microraptor is an intelligent, pack-hunting predator that eats insects and other small animals.",
  "info.coelacanth": "The Coelacanth’s are the last modern Coelacanthiformes fish, dating back to the Devonian. The word \"coelacanth\" means \"hollow spine\". Using 8 different fins, the coelacanth can easily turn in almost any direction. Coelacanths are nocturnal, piscivorous drift-hunters found only in the depths of the Indian Ocean. Prehistoric coelacanths were hugely diverse, unlike the modern day ones.",
  "info.deinotherium": "An extinct relative of elephants and mammoths, Deinotherium lived from the Late Miocene to the Early Pleistocene, about 7-2 million years ago. Its remains have been found in Africa, India, Pakistan, Romania, and Germany. Unlike most other proboscideans (elephant) lineages, Deinotherium had no tusks in the upper jaw. Instead, its tusks extended from the lower jaw and curved downwards.",
  "info.mussaurus": "The Mussaurus is a small prosauropod dinosaur from Argentina during the Late Triassic period. It’s name means \"mouse lizard\" because, for a long time, it was known only from tiny baby skeletons. The proportions of the babies suggest the adults cared for them. Mussaurus are very small for sauropodomorphs and only need lush vegetation, some trees, and water to survive.",
  "info.blue": "The Velociraptor was a small theropod dinosaur that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. It was an opportunist, hunting a wide variety of prey from small mammals or lizards, to medium-sized dinosaurs. Quick, highly intelligent, and highly aggressive, they are very hard to keep. They are accomplished escape artists, rivaling a cheetah's speed, and leaping up to 4 meters vertically.",
  "info.carcharodontosaurus": "Carcharodontosaurus was one of the largest theropod carnivores at a length of about 13.7 meters. It lived in the Cretaceous period (105 to 94 million years ago). It inhabited Africa and possibly South America. The size of the Carcharodontosaurus was an extreme advantage with attacking large sauropods and quickly killing prey.",
  "info.carnotaurus": "Carnotaurus was an abelisaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period(72 - 69.9 million years ago). This 8-9 meter long, 1 ton predator was lightly built. It was a fast runner, possibly the fastest large theropods. Its diet is debated, though some experts think it hunted large prey, carving chunks out of them in quick, devastating attacks, while others think it hunted mainly small prey.",
  "info.cearadactylus": "Cearadactylus was a genus of pterosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period(112 million years ago). Considered medium-large, it had a wingspan of around 4-5 meters and a weight of around 15 kg. Its long, interlocking teeth indicate a diet of mostly fish. Cearadactylus is a highly territorial and bad-tempered pterosaur. They live in flocks of around 5 - 100 individuals, and they tolerate other pterosaurs to an extent.",
  "info.ceratosaurus": "The Ceratosaurus was a 6 meter long, 1 ton predatory dinosaur that lived in North America and Portugal during the Late Jurassic period. Its nasal horn was once thought to be used for fighting, but it is now speculated to be for display. It also had a row of osteoderms running down its back. Its tooth marks have been found on the bones of other large dinosaurs, although whether it hunted them or scavenged them is debatable.",
  "info.charlie": "The Velociraptor was a small theropod dinosaur that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. It was an opportunist, hunting a wide variety of prey from small mammals or lizards, to medium-sized dinosaurs. Quick, highly intelligent, and highly aggressive, they are very hard to keep. They are accomplished escape artists, rivaling a cheetah's speed, and leaping up to 4 meters vertically.",
  "info.chasmosaurus": "Chasmosaurus is a genus of ceratopsid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous Period of North America. Its name means 'opening lizard', referring to the large openings in its frill. Chasmosaurus was most likely similar to triceratops because it was a horned plant-eating herding animal. Chasmosaurus usually feasted on cycads, palms and other prehistoric plants.",
  "info.chilesaurus": "Native to Chile, the Chilesaurus was a species of small theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic, around 145 million years ago. Some of its adaptations to eating plants include specialized teeth and a large gut. If cornered by a predator, it would most likely use the large claws on its hands to defend itself. Since there were several skeletons found, researchers know what the Chilesaurus looks similar to.",
  "info.coelurus": "The Coelurus was a small Coelurasaurian theropod from the Late Jurassic period. Often mislabeled as it’s contemporary Ornitholestes, much of this animal is known from a single individual fossil. Adults growing up to 2.5 meters long and weighing up to 13 kilograms have been found in Wyoming, United States. The name Coelurus comes from the skeleton because the tail of the dinosaur was hollowed.",
  "info.compsognathus": "The Compsognathus is a genus of small, bipedal, carnivorous theropod. Only a member of its single species, the Compsognathus could grow to around the size of a turkey. They lived in Europe 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period. This creature should not be underestimated because of it's smaller size. While a Compsognathus may look harmless when alone, it can be very dangerous in groups.",
  "info.corythosaurus": "Corythosaurus is a hadrosaur dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. It had an immense number of teeth compressed together into \"batteries\", forming a single grinding surface on each side of the upper and lower jaw. This allowed the dinosaur to process copious amounts of food at once. The Corythosaurus had hundreds of small interlocking teeth at the back of its jaw, which allowed it to grind plants much easier.",
  "info.arsinoitherium": "Native to what is now northern and eastern Africa, Arsinoitherium was a mammal that lived during the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene, around 36 - 27 million years ago. Arsinoitherium lived in tropical rainforests and mangrove swamps, in what is now the Sahara desert. Despite their rhinoceros-like appearance, these beasts were actually more closely related to elephants, manatees, and hyraxes.",
  "info.crassigyrinus": "The Crassigyrinus scoticus was a 2 metre (6 foot) long amphibian that lurked in the tropical swamps of Scotland. It lived in the Visean of the Carboniferous around 345-328 million years ago. A fast-moving predator with a powerful bite, its limbs were tiny, so it probably lived in water all of its life. The Crassigyrinus is thought to be an ambush approach. Their big eyes suggested that they were nocturnal and could have hunted in deep water.",
  "info.delta": "The Velociraptor was a small theropod dinosaur that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. It was an opportunist, hunting a wide variety of prey from small mammals or lizards, to medium-sized dinosaurs. Quick, highly intelligent, and highly aggressive, they are very hard to keep. They are accomplished escape artists, rivaling a cheetah's speed, and leaping up to 4 meters vertically.",
  "info.dimorphodon": "The Dimorphodon was a pterosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic period and resided in Europe. It was a piscivore, though their diet sometimes consisted of smaller vertebrates. The Dimorphodon(“two shapes of tooth”) possesses two types of teeth in its beaked jaws, the longer ones in front intended for snagging its prey, and the shorter, flatter ones in back presumably for grinding this prey up easily.",
  "info.diplocaulus": "Native to North America, the Diplocaulus lived from the Early Permian almost up to the Great Dying, or the Permian-Triassic mass extinction(299 - 251 million years ago). This lepospondyl is one of the more famous extinct amphibians. It is thought to have swam in an undulating fashion due to its body shape. Although capable of travelling on land, it most likely spent it’s time in water, hiding in sediment at the bottom.",
  "info.edmontosaurus": "The Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid inhabiting North America(more specifically Montana, Nebraska, and New Jersey), lived during the Late Cretaceous period. The Edmontosaurus was more duck-billed than other dinosaurs and is well known for the crest since it is not as bony as other hadrosaurids. Research suggests that they were nomadic and traveled in large herds for protection from apex predators.",
  "info.giganotosaurus": "The Giganotosaurus was a highly dangerous animal and a hefty predator, most likely specializing in hunting large sauropods. The Giganotosaurus does best in flat, fairly open plains, with large watering holes and patches of trees for ambush spots. The Giganotosaurus females are heftier and more aggressive than the males, being the ones to display and compete for their affections.",
  "info.guanlong": "The Guanlong was 3 meters long, weighed up to 54-90 kg, and had 3 long fingers on each of its hands. The theropod lived in China during the late Jurassic period, roughly around 160 million years ago. It had an air filled crest on its head which gave it the nickname “crown dragon”. This is the earliest known tyrannosaurid dinosaur. The Guanlong may have been discovered with a coat of primitive feathers, although there is no evidence for this.",
  "info.hypsilophodon": "The Hypsilophodon was a small ornithischia that lived in the early Cretaceous period(125 million years ago). It lived in England, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The average length of this dinosaur was 2.3 meters, and it could weigh up to 50kg. It was a passive herbivore, and with it’s small size, this ornithischia was easy prey to the predators. The Hypsilophodon most likely lived in large groups to help keep an eye out for danger.",
  "info.indominus": "Violent, strong, and cunning, this genetically modified hybrid is a mighty force to be reckoned with. At full size, the Indominus can reach 15 meters in length. Only the largest theropods may pose a challenge to it. The Indominus’ genome is composed of many different dinosaurs and other animals, including: Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, Carnotaurus, Majungasaurus, Rugops, Giganotosaurus, and Therizinosaurus.",
  "info.megatherium": "A giant ground sloth, Megatherium was one of the largest land mammals of all time after Paraceratherium and some of the mammoths, measuring up to 6 meters in length, and weighing an estimated 4 tons. Megatherium was closely related to modern sloths and anteaters. Like an anteater, it walked on the sides of its feet, as its toe claws were too long and curved to lie flat on the ground.",
  "info.dunkleosteus": "A powerful marine predator, the Dunkleosteus lived during the Late Devonian period(380-360 million years ago), in North America, Europe, and Africa. It’s mouth has no teeth, but is armed with sharp, bony plates. These plates would've acted like scissors, cutting through its armoured prey with a devastating bite. It is believed that Dunkleosteus would sometimes resort to cannibalism if they could not find another source of food.",
  "info.dodo": "The dodo is one of the most famous extinct animals. These large, flightless birds were closely related to pigeons. Native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, the dodo was driven to extinction through a combination of hunting by humans and pressure from invasive species. These flightless birds typically live either on their own or in small, loose flocks with a pecking order based on the individual's size.",
  "info.echo": "The Velociraptor was a small theropod dinosaur that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. It was an opportunist, hunting a wide variety of prey from small mammals or lizards, to medium-sized dinosaurs. Quick, highly intelligent, and highly aggressive, they are very hard to keep. They are accomplished escape artists, rivaling a cheetah's speed, and leaping up to 4 meters vertically.",
  "info.herrerasaurus": "One of the most primitive theropod dinosaurs known, the Herrerasaurus lived in northwestern Argentina during the Late Triassic period(231.4 million years ago). This early dinosaur is measured between 3 and 6 meters long and was most likely a predator. It stalked the lush floodplains and conifer forests, hunting small to medium-sized prey such as rhynchosaurs, mammal-like reptiles, and smaller dinosaurs.",
  "info.lambeosaurus": "The Lambeosaurus was a herbivorous Hadrosaurid that lived in North America during the Cretaceous period (around 74 to 76 million years ago). The Lambeosaurus was known for its hatchet shaped crest on the top of its head, which produced sounds, enhanced smell, and added to its courtship display. It is believed that the balance of this dinosaur was much better than other hadrosaurids and could walk on it’s rear legs.",
  "info.mawsonia": "The Mawsonia was a carnivorous fish that was known to live across South America and North Africa, around 99 to 112 million years ago. It was a type of Coelacanth and may have had a few predators such as larger sharks, pliosaurs, and perhaps spinosaurid dinosaurs. Similar to other coelacanths, the Mawsonia lived on the seafloor, snatching up fish and larger invertebrates that were sheltering in crevices in rocks and coral.",
  "info.leptictidium": "The Leptictidium was an unusual placental mammal that lived in France and Germany during the Eocene period (around 50 to 35 million years ago). It was an unspecialized omnivore, which ate insects, lizards, smaller mammals, and leaves based on the remains found. It is one of the rare few mammals that walk on its hind legs. It was thought to have jumped everywhere, but it’s bone structure was too weak, so it is now considered an agile runner.",
  "info.leaellynasaura": "The Leaellynasaura is a small herbivorous ornithischian that lived in Australia during the early Cretaceous period (around 118 to 110 million years ago). The Leaellynasaura was about 3 feet in length and weighed around 30kg. Its eyes were enlarged and allowed the herbivore to see in low light levels. There has only been one incomplete fossil found of the Leaellynasaura, which consists of teeth and a juvenile skull.",
  "info.ludodactylus": "The Ludodactylus was a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaurs from the Early Cretaceous period that was found in Ceara, Brazil. It’s name means “toy finger” because of a mistake often made on toy replicas. The Ludodactylus might’ve fed on fish, carcasses, baby dinosaurs, and various other animals. Only one specimen has been found by paleontologists, leaving most information regarding this creature a mystery.",
  "info.mammoth": "The Woolly Mammoth was an extinct relative of elephants that lived during the Pleistocene to Early Holocene period (around 150000 to 4000 years ago). A healthy adult mammoth had few or no natural predators, although the calves, the sick, or elderly adults were vulnerable to wolves, cave hyenas, and big cats. The Woolly Mammoth lived in a large, snowy tundra or grassland area in a cold climate.",
  "info.titanis": "Native to what is now southern North America, Titanis was a large phorusrhacid (or \"terror bird\") that lived during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (around 4.8 - 1.8 million years ago). Although flightless, Titanis is capable of reaching speeds close to those of an ostrich. Although its preferred prey consists mainly of dainty ungulates, keepers should always keep in mind that humans also fall within the size range!",
  "info.majungasaurus": "The Majungasaurus was an abelisaurid theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (around 70-66 million years ago). This opportunistic predator was capable of taking on quite large prey, like small sauropods. It used its knobbly head and strong body to club the victim into submission and finish it off. The Majungasaurus had the possibility of a respiratory system similar to modern birds.",
  "info.megapiranha": "Native to Argentina, the Megapiranha was a characin fish that lived during the Late Miocene period (around 10 - 8 million years ago). The Megapiranha is very similar in appearance and behaviour to its modern piranha relatives, with the exception of its massive size. The only known remains of this fish are it’s large teeth at the front of the jaw, which could have been used for a carnivorous or herbivorous diet.",
  "info.metriacanthosaurus": "Native to England, the Metriacanthosaurus was a theropod dinosaur that lived during the Middle Jurassic period (around 160 million years ago). Despite not being the largest of theropods (8.3 meters long), the Metriacanthosaurus packed quite a punch! This surprisingly muscular dinosaur stuns its prey by charging and ramming into it, finishing it off by tearing its throat.",
  "info.microceratus": "Native to China, the Microceratus was a tiny, herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period(129.4 - 66 million years ago). For its diet, the Microceratus favored several predominant flowering plants of the period including ferns, cycads, and conifers. With its parrot-like beaks, this creature would bite off the leaves or needles in order to eat it.",
  "info.moganopterus": "Native to China, the Moganopterus lived during the Early Cretaceous period (around 125 million years ago). This creature has the longest skull of any known toothed pterosaur and also had a proportionately long neck. The Moganopterus specialized in hunting small prey and was most active during the day. Its habits were somewhat stork or heron-like, because it used its long narrow bill to grab prey in a spear-like striking motion.",
  "info.smilodon": "Smilodon is by far the most famous saber-toothed cat. Its remains have been found in both South America and North America, most notably at the La Brea tar pits in California. They are thought to have lived and hunted in packs or prides like today's lions. Smilodon and other sabretoothed cats specialized in large prey such as horses, bison, giant ground sloths, and possibly even small mammoths.",
  "info.elasmotherium": "Native to Eurasia, Elasmotherium lived during the Late Pliocene to Late Pleistocene, around 2.6 million to 12 thousand years ago. Also known as the \"giant rhinoceros\", this herbivorous beast is most famous for the single, giant horn in its head. It was a grazing animal, that fed mainly on grasses in open plains or tundra.",
  "info.mosasaurus": "One of the largest mosasaurs, the Mosasaurus was a huge marine lizard that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (around 70 to 66 million years ago). It’s bones were found in Europe, North America, Asia, and New Zealand. These giant reptiles are territorial, and they will typically fight unless they are mating or defending their young. This creature lived in large bodies of water and primarily ate fish, plesiosaurs, and even other mosasaurs.",
  "info.ornithomimus": "Native to North America, the Ornithomimus was a swift bipedal theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (74 to 65 million years ago). It is known as the \"bird mimic\" because of its uncanny resemblance to an ostrich. The Ornithomimus likely behaved like an ostrich as well, possibly being able to sustain running speeds of about 30 miles per hour.",
  "info.oviraptor": "Native to Mongolia, the Oviraptor was a species of oviraptorid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (around 75 million years ago). Its name means \"egg thief\", primarily because the skeleton was discovered lying on top of what was presumed to be a clutch of Protoceratops eggs. The jaws of the Oviraptor would crush hard objects and it is presumed that the dinosaur ate eggs, fish, and shellfish.",
  "info.othnielia": "Native to what is now North America, this herbivorous ornithopod dinosaur lived during the Late Jurassic period (237 to 66 million years ago). The Othnielia was between 5 and 6.6 ft in length, weighing around 22 lbs. The limbs of this ornithopod show us that it may have also been a good runner. Unfortunately, the Othnielia isn't well-known and there have only been few fossils found of this dinosaur.",
  "info.pachycephalosaurus": "The Pachycephalosaurus, or “Thick-Headed Lizard”, lived in North America during the late Cretaceous Period (about 72 - 66 million years ago). It likes to live in small-medium sized packs and most likely ate plants. The Pachycephalosaurus had a dome-like skull up to 24 cm thick with small bumps and spikes. It is currently known as the largest dome-skulled dinosaur today.",
  "info.postosuchus": "Native to North America, the Postosucus lived during the Middle - Late Triassic Period (230 - 220 million years ago). There were numerous debates regarding the classification of the postosuchus. Some considered it an archosaur(Post crocodile; Eventually evolved into a crocodile or pterosaur) before it was classified as a rauisuchid reptile. The postosuchus takes the title of the one of the largest rauisuchian and last of its kind.",
  "info.proceratosaurus": "Native to England, Proceratosaurus was a theropod dinosaur that lived during the Mid Jurassic period (165 million years ago). Originally thought to be a relative of Ceratosaurus, it has since been re-classified as a coelurosaur. Specifically, it was an early tyrannosauroid like its close relative Guanlong. A Proceratosaurus will need a fenced-off wooded area, with plenty of undergrowth to hide in.",
  "info.protoceratops": "Native to Mongolia, the Protoceratops was a herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous Period(83 - 70 million years ago). It was a much smaller creature that lacked well-developed horns, had a fragile frill, and retained some primitive traits not seen in later genera. Despite their small appearance, these creatures had very strong jaw muscles that allowed them to be able to create a very powerful bite.",
  "info.pteranodon": "The Pteranodon lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period. It was a fish-eater that soared over the ocean surface, especially common around the Western Interior Seaway. They tolerate other pterosaurs, but will often become aggressive if confronted by a large bipedal creature (mainly theropods, though unfortunately the sight of humans can also set them off).",
  "info.quetzalcoatlus": "Quetzalcoatlus lived in North America at the very end of the Late Cretaceous period. With an estimated wingspan of 10 meters or more, it was one of the largest pterosaurs, and one of the largest flying animals of all time. When standing, it would've been tall enough to look a giraffe in the eye. Quetzalcoatlus are opportunistic predators and scavengers, equally happy to both terrorize smaller creatures or scavenge off of them.",
  "info.rugops": "Native to Africa, the Rugops is a medium sized theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period(95 million years ago). It is one of the less challenging Abelisaurs to take care of. Rugops isn't particularly fussy about where it lives, although it does best in flat, fairly open land with quite shallow water. Although Rugops is primarily a scavenger, it may occasionally go after small prey such as lizards, birds, and very small dinosaurs.",
  "info.segisaurus": "Native to North America, the Segisaurus was a carnivorous coelophysoid theropod that lived during the Jurassic Period(183 million years ago). This small theropod had a long tail and forearms. It had powerful legs that were long compared to its body length. The Segisaurus was also a good representation of early theropods for scientists. It was most likely restricted to hunting insects and small vertebrates like lizards.",
  "info.spinosaurus": "Native to North Africa, the Spinosaurus a gigantic theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early to Late Cretaceous period (112 - 97 million years ago).

  "info.stegosaurus": "Primarily in North America, the Stegosaurus (“roofed lizard”) was an armored, herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the late Jurassic Period (155 - 150 million years ago). It is the largest and most well known with plates used to regulate temperature and for display, and large spikes near the end of the tail used for defense against predators. It is the most well known dinosaur due to its abundance of fossils, and it's nearly complete skeleton.",
  "info.styracosaurus": "The Styracosaurus, or spiked lizard, is a ceratopsian dinosaur that lived in North America during the late Cretaceous period(or 76 to 70 million years ago). Not much is known about the Styracosaurus. It has walked with herds, but it appears to mostly have lived in solidarity, unlike several other horned dinosaurs. The strong teeth of the herbivore suggests that it was able to eat tough vegetation that other dinosaurs may have struggled with.",
  "info.indoraptor": "Indoraptor was the passion project of geneticist Dr. Wu. It was created from the recovered genome of the Indominus rex along with extra Velociraptor DNA. Growing up to 7 meters long and 2 meters high, it is one of the few mainly quadrupedal theropods. The Indoraptor could cause mass military destruction; it had a strong sense of smell, echolocation and was genetically bred to respond to laser commands.",
  "info.suchomimus": "Found in Niger, the Suchomimus(or “crocodile mimic”) was a large theropod living in the early Cretaceous period or about 121 to 112 million years ago. Their poor natured fossils are hard to learn about, but the Suchomimus is speculated to have a similar lifestyle to other spinosaurids. It did not completely rely on fish and was an opportunist who fed on dinosaurs and pterosaurs.",
  "info.therizinosaurus": "Native to Mongolia, Therizinosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous period(85 - 70 million years ago). These dinosaurs were among the largest herbivorous theropods, with a length of around 9 - 12 meters. The Latin meaning, \"scythe lizard\", refers to the strange, meter-long claws on the dinosaur's arms. It's speculated they used them to either bring down foliage to eat or for display during the breeding season.",
  "info.troodon": "Native to North America, the Troodon lived during the Late Cretaceous period(77.5 - 69 million years ago). Troodon had very large eyes, indicating it had excellent vision, possibly suggesting it had hunted at night. The eyes faced forward, meaning it probably had binocular vision and, therefore good depth perception. It also had the largest braincase of any currently known dinosaur.",
  "info.raphusrex": "Raphus Rex was bred to be one of the most remarkable of all dinosaur hybrids, but it has proved to be extremely unpredictable. The genetic makeup of this creature gives it the beak and feathers of a Dodo throughout the body, and the head and body of a Tyrannosaurus. The way the eyes are placed on the head gives it the binocular vision of a Tyrannosaurus placing the final touches for this remarkably majestic brute.",
  "info.tylosaurus": "The Tylosaurus lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period, around 88 - 80.5 million years ago. The Tylosaurus led violent, territorial lives, and their bones are often found with bite marks and other injuries inflicted by their own species. The stomach contents show that they were apex predators eating fish, sharks, plesiosaurs, Hesperornis, and smaller mosasaurs.",
  "info.tropeognathus": "The Tropeognathus, or “keep jaw”, is a pterosaur that lived in Brazil during the Albian of the Cretaceous period(or 110 million years ago). It is one of the largest pterosaurs, and has adapted to flying over large bodies of water. The Tropeognathus had a toothed beak, and large round growths named “keels”. There are not many remains of this creature, so it doesn’t have very much genetic information.",
  "info.zhenyuanopterus": "The Zhenyuanopterus lived in China during the Early Cretaceous period (around 125 million years ago). It is a mild-mannered, somewhat skittish creature that is most active in the daylight. If threatened or disturbed, it would much rather flee than attack, so it didn’t risk breaking it’s teeth. They travel together in small, disorganized gangs (of about 3 - 12 individuals) with no clear \"leader\".",
  "info.hyaenodon": "The Hyaenodon was a highly successful genus of Creodont that lived from the Late Eocene to the early Miocene in Asia, Africa, and North America. Despite their appearance, Creodonts were a separate order to the more familiar Carnivora. The two orders separated from a common ancestor around the K-T boundary. Hyaenodons were extremely efficient predators that were able to spread across most of the world.",
  "info.dreadnoughtus": "Native to Argentina in the Late Cretaceous period, the Dreadnoughtus was a towering giant that dwarfed most other sauropods in sheer scale. Like most of Titanosauria, it’s hide was studded with small, boney osteoderms that protected the weaker juveniles from predators. They would have lived in loose herds of 3-4 members, but usually regrouped in large numbers during mating season.",
  "info.sinoceratops": "Sinoceratops was a large ceratopsian that lived in East Asia during the Late Cretaceous. Their diet was mainly made up of tough plant matter such as ferns and cycads. Unlike their larger cousin triceratops, Sinoceratops only had a single nose horn but made up for this in a much more elaborate frill. They mainly lived in smaller family groups than other ceratopsians of 4-10 individuals led by a breeding pair.",
  "info.spinoraptor": "Spinoraptor is a hereditarily altered type of dinosaur, made by Dr. Henry Wu by consolidating the base genome of Spinosaurus with that of Velociraptor. The Spinoraptor is a social creature and needs somewhere in the range of two and four individuals from their species to stay content.",
  "info.diplodocus": "Native to North America during the Late Jurassic (about 154-150 million years ago), Diplodocus could grow up to about 35 meters in length, and an estimated 10-16 tons in weight. Although not the biggest known sauropod, it is still the longest dinosaur of which a complete skeleton has been found. Due to their massive size, fully grown, healthy Diplodocus most likely didn't need to worry too much about predators.",
  "info.ankylodocus": "Ankylodocus is a hereditarily changed types of dinosaur, made by Dr. Henry Wu by consolidating the base genome of Diplodocus with that of Ankylosaurus. Ankylodocus has the long, level figure of the sauropod Diplodocus, and the forcing, cautious highlights of the Ankylosaurus, for example, sharp spikes covering its back and a clubbed tail.",
  "info.camarasaurus": "One of the most common sauropods, Camarasaurus lived in North America during the Late Jurassic. It had very strong teeth, and little evidence of gastroliths (gizzard stones), implying that it may have processed its food to some degree before swallowing it. Its diet would mostly have consisted of tough, fibrous plants.",
